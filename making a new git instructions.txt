i made a new git project on git website called settler using gitignore profile unity
i made a new folder on c called settler
i used git desktop app to clone the new git project into the c drive settler folder
i used winmerge to compare my old gitignore from skater with my new one from settler and put in things i thought should be there
i went into unity loaded skater and exported the assets
i temp renamed the settler folder inside the settler folder (sic) something else
i made a new unity project called settler and selected the settler folder (top one) to put it in. unity made a settler folder inside it
i copied the .gitignore and stuff from the renamed settler directory into the one unity made
i manually copied projectsettings/inputmanager.asset from skater to settler
