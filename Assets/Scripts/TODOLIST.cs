/* TODO LIST
 
ultimately low priority


text rendering is upside down. it works but would be nice to negative the y thing in the rect and not have to 7 - (c/32)
there has to be a better way to set the minimap to all black at the start

monsters
items


stop maus auto walk if : see monster, item, take damage, press a key, press maus again
cursor when maus over viewport?
hover for square info

change empty square to q. problem with this is that you can't then access it by index so you can't shuffle it.


 * 
 * particle type system: numbers that float up, blood splatters
 * tooltips. maybe have signs you can read with hover. also allow keyboard
 * 
 * 
 * weapon effects:
 * lightning gun: a beam of lightning like from a tesla coil
 * fire weapon: flamethrower effect using particles
 * sonic weapon: maybe sprites that look like concentric ovals
 * normal ammo: small sprite fast moving represents bullet
